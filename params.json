DEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\nCurrently assuming Mac OS X environment, with interactive console.\r\n\r\nA. Executables\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\n  perl\r\n        The perl interpreter (or a link to it) should be in /usr/bin.\r\n\r\n  make or gmake\r\n        Apple/OS X Developer command-line tools. \r\n        See http://www.macports.org/install.php\r\n  R     http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx\r\n        To ensure integrity of the dowloaded file, run 'md5' command on\r\n        it and compare with published value.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n  phyml\r\n       Not strictly necessary but helpful for all but the largest alignments.\r\n\r\n        If you choose not to use phyml to make trees, you will have to\r\n        customize the Makefile and/or ensure the Newick tree file\r\n        contains the same prefix as the Fasta alignment file.  Be\r\n        aware that make might over-write this file.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Newick utilities\r\n       Currently used only for nw_reroot but has great general utility.\r\n       http://cegg.unige.ch/newick_utils\r\n\r\nB. C library\r\n\r\n  libgd\r\n        This is the trickiest component to build and install from source.\r\n        Using macports to obtain the pre-built 'gs' will install this for you.\r\n        Install the library before installing the perl module below.\r\n        See http://www.macports.org/install.php\r\n\r\nC. PERL module/s\r\n\r\n  bioperl\r\n        See http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_BioPerl_on_Unix\r\n  GD\r\n        perl -MCPAN -e 'install \"GD\"'  (Easy, right?)\r\n\r\nD. R packages\r\n\r\n  png\r\n    http://cran.r-project.org/package=png\r\n\r\n  ape\r\n    http://cran.r-project.org/package=ape\r\n\r\n  To install these from within R using install.packages(), firewall rules \r\n  require that the proxy server be set as follows:\r\n      export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080\r\n      export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080\r\n      or within R, Sys.setenv(\"HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyout.lanl.gov:8080\"), etc.\r\n\r\n  Otherwise, manually download and install them from the command line, e.g:\r\n    R CMD INSTALL ape_3.0-9.tgz\r\n  You will have to download and install the other required packages:\r\n    http://cran.r-project.org/package=nlme\r\n    http://cran.r-project.org/package=gee\r\n    http://cran.r-project.org/package=expm\r\n\r\nII. Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Files are mistreated when inserted into MS Office ppt or doc files.\r\n- Goal is to replace png files generated by pixel with pure-R raster images.\r\n- This version assumes nucleotide sequences.\r\n\r\nFIN\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
